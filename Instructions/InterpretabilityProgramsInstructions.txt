Program: sRNATarget_SHAP.py

Command to run:
python sRNARFTarget_SHAP.py sRNA_ID mRNA_ID

Example usage:
python sRNARFTarget_SHAP.py 'omrA' 'ompT' 

First parameter:  Python script name, sRNARFTarget_SHAP.py

Second parameter: sRNA id same as in Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory and should be in single quotes. For example: 'omrA'

Third parameter: mRNA id same as in Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory and should be in single quotes. For example: 'ompT'

Note : 
1) Second and Third parameter are ids of sRNA-mRNA pair from Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory.

2) This program can be run for one sRNA-mRNA pair at a time.

Program: sRNATarget_CP.py

Command to run:
python sRNARFTarget_CP.py sRNA_ID mRNA_ID feature_name

Example usage:
python sRNARFTarget_CP.py 'omrA' 'ompT' 'GCG'

First parameter:  Python script name, sRNARFTarget_CP.py

Second parameter: sRNA id same as in Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory and should be in single quotes. For example: 'omrA'

Third parameter: mRNA id same as in Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory and should be in single quotes. For example: 'ompT'

Fourth parameter: Feature/variable name. For example : 'GCG' or 'TAA' and so on.

Note : 
1) Second and Third parameter are ids of sRNA-mRNA pair from Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory.

2) This program can be run for one sRNA-mRNA pair and a single feature/variable at a time.

Additional notes: 

First run sRNATarget_SHAP.py for an sRNA-mRNA pair of interest selected from Prediction_probabilities.csv file under sRNARFTargetResult directory. Then based on the results of this program, run the sRNATarget_CP.py for the same sRNA-mRNA pair and for a single feature of interest for this pair.
