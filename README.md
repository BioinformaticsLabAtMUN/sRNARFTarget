# sRNARFTarget: A machine learning-based approach for sRNA Target Prediction #
  
  ## Introduction

    This repository contains all the codes, data, results and supplementary files related to 'sRNARFTarget' program for sRNA target prediction.
  
  ## Instructions to run sRNARFTarget
  
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Keep the sRNA and mRNA fasta files of interest in sRNARFTarget-master folder.
    3. Set 'sRNARFTarget-master' as current working directory.
    4. Run the below command to run sRNARFTarget. Replace srna.fasta with the fasta file of sRNAs and mrna.fasta with the fasta file of mRNAs.
   
   #### nextflow run sRNARFTarget.nf --s srna.fasta --m mrna.fasta
